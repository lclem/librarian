  Abstract      = "The subject originates in the 1950s with Abraham Robinson when he established the model completeness of the theory of algebraically closed valued fields. In the 1960s Ax {\\&} Kochen and, independently, Ershov, proved a remarkable theorem on henselian valued fields, with applications to p-adic number theory. These results and their refinements and extensions remain important in more recent developments like motivic integration.",
