  Abstract      = "Verification involves checking the correctness of computer programs, conducted on a model of the overall system, and often this model is a Petri net. In the context of safety, verification may mean showing that a system cannot reach an unsafe state. Richard J. Lipton established a lower bound on the reachability for Petri nets, we discuss how this came about.",
